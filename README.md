ðŸ‘‹ Nothing to see here yet, will hold the current state (application layer) for my Kubernetes K3s cluster (replicated from my self-hosted) Gitlab. This GitOps repo will also cover Kubernetes support tools and other self-hosted applications I'm running (includes guides). Cluster is comprised of Raspberry Pis (3 & 4), Jetson Nanos and a bunch of old Thinkpads I've collected over the years. I physically assembled the cluster when I had a tiny bit of free time during paternity leave in the summer of 2021. Now with 2 little ones, I try to work on this (software and automation side) late at night when everyone is asleep. I was originally inspired to go big on this (before crazy price increases for Pi and Nano) by a local member project at Dallas Makerspace that had his project posted around the web: 
 - https://hackaday.com/2014/02/17/40-node-raspi-cluster/
 - https://dallasmakerspace.org/wiki/40-node_Raspberry_Pi_Cluster

I'll be using Github pages for an associated blog tied to this project: https://antoinesylvia.github.io/Autoplex-Cluster/

Note: Other people that will have access to this cluster will be my cousins looking to attain hands-on skills needed for their pursuit of entry level jobs, wife (engineer) and friends (security engineers) when it's all said and done. One step at a time.
